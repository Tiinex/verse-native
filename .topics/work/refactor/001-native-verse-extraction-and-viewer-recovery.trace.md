# Native Verse extraction and Viewer recovery

## Objective

Extract the standard human-readable Tiinex presentation from App into an independently versioned Native Verse while preserving the Viewer value demonstrated by the earlier PoC.

## Done Criteria

- The repository boundary is explicit and independently understandable.
- Package/release identity matches `Tiinex/verse-native` and `@tiinex/verse-native`.
- Shared contracts are consumed through public neutral surfaces rather than copied sibling implementation.
- Qualification is fast, use-case oriented and fail-closed where lineage, source identity, authority or destructive behavior is involved.

## Scope

Native presentation, navigation, lineage/audit views and human orientation. Shared Universe/Workspace/Verse hosting and application data-plane mechanics remain in App.

## Dependencies

- Controlling Business lineage: `business::.topics/initiatives/refactor/repositories/001-turn-2-repository-decomposition-frontier.trace.md`.
- Shared contract changes remain owned by their current repository/semantic authority and are returned to Refactor Anchor for reconciliation.
